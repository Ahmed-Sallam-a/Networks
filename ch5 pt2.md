### **Summary of Abbreviations and Definitions**

This section provides a concise summary of all the **abbreviations** and **definitions** used in Chapter 5: Quality of Service and Internetworking. Each term is explained in the context of network protocols, traffic management, and internetworking.

---

### **1. Quality of Service (QoS) Abbreviations**

1. **QoS (Quality of Service)**:
   - **Definition**: The ability of a network to provide better service to selected network traffic by managing **bandwidth**, **delay**, **jitter**, and **packet loss**.

2. **SLA (Service Level Agreement)**:
   - **Definition**: A contract between a network provider and a customer that specifies the expected level of service, including traffic patterns and QoS guarantees.

3. **CBR (Constant Bit Rate)**:
   - **Definition**: A type of traffic that requires a fixed bit rate, such as uncompressed voice calls.

4. **RT-VBR (Real-Time Variable Bit Rate)**:
   - **Definition**: A type of traffic that requires real-time transmission but with variable bit rates, such as compressed videoconferencing.

5. **NRT-VBR (Non-Real-Time Variable Bit Rate)**:
   - **Definition**: A type of traffic that does not require real-time transmission but has variable bit rates, such as video on demand.

6. **ABR (Available Bit Rate)**:
   - **Definition**: A type of traffic that uses whatever bandwidth is available, such as file transfers.

7. **RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol)**:
   - **Definition**: A protocol used in **Integrated Services (IntServ)** to reserve network resources for specific flows, ensuring QoS guarantees.

8. **IntServ (Integrated Services)**:
   - **Definition**: A QoS architecture that provides end-to-end QoS guarantees by reserving resources along the path of a flow.

9. **DiffServ (Differentiated Services)**:
   - **Definition**: A simpler QoS architecture that classifies traffic into different service classes and provides different levels of service based on the class.

10. **WFQ (Weighted Fair Queueing)**:
    - **Definition**: A packet scheduling algorithm that assigns different weights to different flows, allowing some flows to get more bandwidth than others.

11. **RED (Random Early Detection)**:
    - **Definition**: A congestion control mechanism where routers drop packets randomly when the average queue length exceeds a threshold.

### **2. Internetworking Abbreviations**

1. **IP (Internet Protocol)**:
   - **Definition**: A universal protocol used for routing packets across different networks. It provides a common packet format that all routers recognize.

2. **MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)**:
   - **Definition**: A protocol used in telecommunications networks to direct data based on short path labels rather than long network addresses, improving routing efficiency.

3. **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**:
   - **Definition**: The interdomain routing protocol used in the Internet to route traffic between different autonomous systems (AS).

4. **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**:
   - **Definition**: A simple packet scheduling algorithm where packets are sent in the order they arrive.

5. **FCFS (First-Come First-Serve)**:
   - **Definition**: Another term for FIFO, where packets are served in the order they arrive.

### **3. Key Definitions**

1. **Traffic Shaping**:
   - **Definition**: A technique used to control the rate of data transmission to ensure that the network can handle the traffic without congestion.

2. **Traffic Policing**:
   - **Definition**: Monitoring traffic to ensure compliance with the SLA. Excess packets may be dropped or marked with lower priority.

3. **Leaky Bucket Algorithm**:
   - **Definition**: A traffic shaping algorithm that smooths out bursty traffic by converting it into a steady stream of packets. If the bucket overflows, packets are discarded.

4. **Token Bucket Algorithm**:
   - **Definition**: A traffic shaping algorithm that allows bursts of traffic up to a certain limit by using tokens. Each packet requires a token to be transmitted.

5. **Packet Scheduling**:
   - **Definition**: The process of determining the order in which packets are transmitted from a router's queue. Common algorithms include FIFO, Fair Queueing, and Weighted Fair Queueing.

6. **Admission Control**:
   - **Definition**: A mechanism that ensures new flows are only admitted if the network has enough resources to handle them without degrading the QoS of existing flows.

7. **Flow Specification**:
   - **Definition**: A set of parameters that describe the traffic characteristics of a flow, such as token bucket rate, token bucket size, peak data rate, and packet size.

8. **Multicast Spanning Tree**:
   - **Definition**: A tree structure used in multicast routing to ensure that packets are delivered to all members of a multicast group.

9. **Expedited Forwarding**:
   - **Definition**: A DiffServ class that provides low delay and low loss for high-priority traffic.

10. **Assured Forwarding**:
    - **Definition**: A DiffServ class that provides four priority levels (gold, silver, bronze) and three discard levels (low, medium, high), resulting in 12 service classes.

11. **Tunneling**:
    - **Definition**: A technique used to connect isolated networks by encapsulating packets from one network inside the packets of another network.

12. **Intradomain Routing**:
    - **Definition**: Routing within a single network using protocols like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First).

13. **Interdomain Routing**:
    - **Definition**: Routing between different networks using protocols like BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).

### **4. Key Formulas**

1. **Leaky Bucket Algorithm**:
   - **Formula**: \( T = \frac{C}{R} \), where \( C \) is the bucket capacity and \( R \) is the output rate.
   - **Example**: If \( C = 1 \text{ MB} \) and \( R = 2 \text{ Mbps} \), then \( T = 500 \text{ ms} \).

2. **Token Bucket Algorithm**:
   - **Formula**: \( S = \frac{C}{M - R} \), where \( C \) is the bucket capacity, \( M \) is the maximum output rate, and \( R \) is the token arrival rate.
   - **Example**: If \( C = 500 \text{ KB} \), \( M = 25 \text{ Mbps} \), and \( R = 2 \text{ Mbps} \), then \( S = 22 \text{ ms} \).

3. **Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ)**:
   - **Formula**: \( F_i = \max(F_{i-1}, A_i) + \frac{L_i}{W} \), where \( F_i \) is the finish time, \( A_i \) is the arrival time, \( L_i \) is the packet length, and \( W \) is the weight of the flow.
